	* src/fight.c: fixed bug in do_shoot().
	  Bug reported by Adrian Cartmell.
	  Fix by MistBlade.

	* src/fight.c: some other minor tweaks to make mobs a bit harder.

	* changed lots of integer values in the 'char_data' and 'pc_data'
	structures from 'int' to 'int_16'.

	have objects which boost their stats. also made them level dependent
	for mobiles - i.e. the higher the mobile's level, the higher the stats.

	* src/fight.c: fixed bug (fire shield, chill shield and electric
	shield all made DAM_FIRE).

	* src/comm.c: changed code for colour() and colourconv() so that it now
	shows the {'s to a player without colour on, etc.
