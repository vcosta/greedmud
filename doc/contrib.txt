If your name isn't in here, and you think it should be; or if your name IS
in here and you prefer a different name or anonymity; then just e-mail me
and i'll fix it in the next release.



=== Information

Almost all of the features of GreedMud were heavily based on work done by
someone else, so they are who deserve your credits not me. I mostly limited
myself to porting the code to the Envy 2.2 code base, fixing bugs, and
usually rewriting some code. I wrote some details to the porting work
bellow so you can use them for your reference.
