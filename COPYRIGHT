Zen             <vasco.costa@tecnico.ulisboa.pt>



OBS: A couple of people have been using GreedMud source, whole or pieces 
of it, and not mentioning anywhere its origin. Neither on source, online 
help or programmer docs. You know who you are. Shame on you.

This release is dedicated to all the people who have contributed code, bug 
reports or thoughts that helped improve GreedMud. To the players: I hope 
you enjoy playing the game as much as I did developing it.

=== Copyright and License Terms

GreedMud 1.0.1 is a derivative of EnvyMud, version 2.2, and is subject to 
the copyright and license agreements for Diku Mud, Merc Diku Mud and Envy Mud.
The modifications and improvements from EnvyMud version 2.2 contained 
in GreedMud are copyright (C) 1997-2021 by Vasco Costa.

In order to use GreedMud you must follow the Diku license, the Merc license,
the Envy license and my license.  The exact terms of the Diku license are in the
file 'license.doc'.  A summary of these terms is:

        -- No resale or operation for profit.
        -- Original author's names must appear in login sequence.
        -- The 'credits' command must report original authors.
        -- You must notify the Diku creators that you are operating a Diku mud.

The exact terms of the Merc license are in the file 'license.txt'.  A 
summary of these terms is:

        -- Copyrights must remain in original source.
        -- 'Help merc' must report Merc help text, as shipped.

The exact terms of the Envy license are in the file 'license.nvy'.  A 
summary of these terms is:

        -- Copyrights must remain in original source.
        -- 'Help envy' must report Envy help text, as shipped.

My terms are:
        -- Copyrights must remain in original source.
        -- 'Help greed' must report Greed help text, as shipped.
        -- Don't forget to follow the Envy, Merc and Diku licenses. You should
	   find them in the 'doc' directory.

Neither the Merc, EnvyMud nor GreedMud license terms require keeping author
names in the 'greeting' text.  If you want to include a reference to Merc and
its authors (Furey, Hatchet, and Kahn), EnvyMud and its authors (Kahn and
Hatchet) or GreedMud author (Zen), they would appreciate it, but do not
require it.  However, you must keep the original Diku authors in the login
sequence.
